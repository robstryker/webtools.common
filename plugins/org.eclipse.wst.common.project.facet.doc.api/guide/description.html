<p class="ueberschrift">Faceted Project Framework</p>

<p>The Faceted Project Framework allows the plugin developer to think of 
projects as composed of units of functionality, otherwise known as facets, that 
can be added and removed by the user.</p>

<p>Project facets are most frequently used for adding natures, builders, 
classpath entries, and resources to a project.</p>

<p>Primary Benefits</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consistent user experience.</li>
  <li>Ability to accurately describe capabilities of the runtime platform.</li>
</ul>
